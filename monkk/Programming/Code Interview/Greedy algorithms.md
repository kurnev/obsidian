Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for Greedy.

They do not give you the perfect solution, but give you one that is pretty close to it. Which is most of the times is good enough.
