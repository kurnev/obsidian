Big O notation is special notation that tells you how fast an algorithm is.

Big O doesnâ€™t tell you the speed in seconds. Big O notation lets you compare the number of operations. It tells you how fast the algorithm grows.

Big O is about worst case scenario

If two algo has different big O - you ignore the constant (c * n), which is basicall yhow long it takes do one run for this algo.
