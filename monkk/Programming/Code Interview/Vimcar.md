Collaboration block: 

**Tell me the last time you sought out help at work. What did you ask for help with and why did you decide you needed the help?**

STAR:
I have a rule that I google and think about any question that rises up for at least 15 minutes, to have better understanding of a field.

Help is different from questyions, but I ask quesitons a lot, if i cant google it in 15 minutes. Help means you are tottally lost 

Maybe with how the project is structured and why, and with some legacy old code or just architecture quesitons.

When I was stuck refactorion big chains of compon ents in React. 

**Tell me about a time when you had to adjust to a colleague’s working style in order to complete a project or achieve your objectives.**

Adjust is not the right word for me, I think. It is about adjusting and losing your values, it is more about working as a team and achieving progress and milestones together. In the end I do care about the project I am in.

If we speak about codestyle and code syntax I always try to force to check those using automated tools. 

If I am really uncoformable about something I bring it up on retrospectives or straight away and we try to gfind a consenus. For example, I was not happy about big MRs from my colleagues at Arrival that came up several times, so we discused and improved it. 

**Give me an example where you collaborated with individuals or teams outside your business area to deliver a positive outcome.**

That happened in Arrival with shared UI\UX component library . Basiscally we had a shaerd libarry between several departments and each department had its needs (diffiretn functionality for a button, select, tables) for the library and it was a bit of mess. So after witnessing it for a couple of days I initaited a call with all the colleagues to discuss it and find some people who would work on the library in a more structued way. We also came up to a consluciotn to split our share monolith UI library by components so it is easier for versiongiong .

**Tell me about a time where you had to form partnerships with others to secure the resources needed to achieve your work goals.**

 Smae as aboev 
 
 **Tell me about how you established rapport with a new member of your team or department.**
 
 I believe it is important for a newcomer to feel comfortable speaking up or asking quiestions. So I usually initiate some smalltalks, networking. Ask baout what he is doing etc. It is fun to know people around


**Describe a situation where your colleagues disagreed with your ideas. What did you do?**

Arrival. I had a colleague who was a little picky about MRs in general. He would sometimes make comments about codestyle or some syntax in React. For example, I was writing  on several lienes, we he prefered oneliner. So we made a call with all our teammembers and disscuseed it. We later made Jira task to improve the workflow and automate additional eslint rules. 

**Describe a challenging situation you have faced recently at work, and how you tackled it.**

Arrival. Refactotring flex logic page for flow and process diagrams with HTML nodes as first class citizens. It took some time.
