Also  **Brewer's Theorem**
A distributed system can deliver only two of three characteristics:
_**consistency**, **availability**,_ and _**partition tolerance**_

### Consistency

Consistency means that all clients see the same data at the same time, no matter which node they connect to.

### Availability

Availability means that that any client making a request for data gets a response, even if one or more nodes are down.

### Partition tolerance

A _partition_ is a communications break within a distributed systemâ€”a lost or temporarily delayed connection between two nodes. Partition tolerance means that the cluster must continue to work despite any number of communication breakdowns between nodes in the system.
