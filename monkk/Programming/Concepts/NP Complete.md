A problem is NP-complete when 
1. You can easily check correctness of the solution and you can brute-force all solutions
2. problem can b used to simulate every other problem for which we can verify quickly that a solution is correct.

Travelling salesperson and finding all sets

They have no known fast solutiuons.

NP Complete problem are almost everywhere, if you spot one -  you should approximate it

How to identify if a problem is NP-Cpomlete (but it is hard):

1. your algo runs quiclkly on small, but slows down on big number of N
2. u need to calc very possible solution
3. involves a squence 
4. is a set-coverting problem
