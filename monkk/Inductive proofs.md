Inductive proofs are one way to prove that your algorithm works. Each inductive proof has two  
steps: the base case and the inductive case. For example,  
suppose I want to prove that I can climb to the top of a ladder. In the  
inductive case, if my legs are on a rung, I can put my legs on the next rung.  
So if I’m on rung 2, I can climb to rung 3. That’s the inductive case. For  
the base case, I’ll say that my legs are on rung 1. Therefore, I can climb the  
entire ladder, going up one rung at a time
